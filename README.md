My personal website.

This is a work in progress and always being updated. Some things I still would like to do include:

- [ ] Add a blog.
- [ ] Add a page for physical objects I have made.
- [ ] The 'about me' section needs some work.
- [ ] Make things more interactive and responsive with JavaScript. I have had more experience working with the language, and it would be good practice to apply it to web development.
- [ ] Move away from simply black and white, adding some color and more interesting layouts.
