          <p>It always amazes me how much sound we tune out. Actually, not even tune out since tuning out 
            requires an initial acknowledgment. Much of the sounds wouldn’t have ever existed for me if I 
            were not purposefully listening for them. We do this with all of our senses, but for me, it 
            seems to happen most with sound. 
          </p>
          <p>It was also hard to listen without attaching meaning to what I was hearing. For instance, if 
            I heard the screeching of masking tape being unrolled, I immediately considered how someone 
            was packing up something. Or if I heard the rustle of leaves, I thought how they must have 
            fallen off of a tree, and were now skipping across the ground. Everything I heard was 
            immediately categorized, given a name, and then rather than considering the sound itself, I 
            considered what was making that sound.
          </p>
          <p>It was hard to get to a point were I simply took in the sounds and let them speak for 
            themselves. In fact, I don’t think I ever truly did that. I think that it would be really 
            interesting to get to a point where you were able to take in sound as a pure form, but also
            unsettling in a way.
